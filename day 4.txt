Java script :
Dynamic typing -> if we need to assign a variable we need to initialize the variable 
int a = 5 ==> here int is type initialization
in dynamic typing we can change the type
static typing -> we cant change the type
in JS
assigning variable ->
a = 5
a = "aswin"
a = 5.12

here 'a' is called as undefined variable. because we are not initializing variable.

Data types => int, string, float, boolean, complex, char (a = 'a' we can assing only one value to the variable)
char a = "A"
char b[10] = "aswin"
var, let, constant ==> defined variables in JS

constant-the value could not be changed - global scope

var - we can change the values - global scope

let - local scope

console.log() - used to print the values

script tag -lnk scripting file in html
